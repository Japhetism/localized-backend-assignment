Africa has a lot to offer and its melody is just one part of it and so it‚Äôs only right to design an app that has a carefully curated list of afrobeat music dated from the 1960s down to what‚Äôs on the trend table.The front cover features Burna boy, a top musician from Nigeria who was awarded a Grammy on March 14, 2021.</p><p>The focus of the app is to delight its users with the afrobeat fusions and we do this by creating an appealing and intuitive interface and this is achieved through colors, text, patterns, illustrations e.t.c</p></div>",
